    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm & Focused (Light Neutral, Calming Blues/Greens, Warm Accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a non-linear "Idea Workbench" with four distinct phases: Foundation, Exploration, Creation, and Validation, plus a "Quizzes" section. This structure groups the report's 10 steps into logical, task-oriented sections, allowing users to navigate based on their current needs rather than following a rigid, linear document. Key interactions include interactive checklists, a conceptual chart, clickable cards for trends with detail reveals, a dynamic diagram for niching down, an interactive brainstorming tool (SCAMPER) with dynamic prompts, a process flow for validation with step details, and interactive quizzes. This design choice prioritizes user engagement and active participation over passive reading, making the process of idea generation more dynamic and intuitive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Self-Assessment: Interactive checklist (HTML/JS) for reflection, and a dynamic feedback message. Goal: Inform/Engage. 2. Problem-Solving: Significantly Enhanced Horizontal Bar chart (Chart.js) with granular problem examples, distinct category colors, and a custom plugin for background category bands for visual grouping and detailed insights. Goal: Inform/Compare. 3. Trend Spotting: Clickable cards (HTML/JS) to reveal more detailed content about each trend. Goal: Inform/Explore. 4. Niche Down: Interactive funnel diagram (HTML/CSS/JS) with expanded explanations on specificity. Goal: Organize/Inform. 5. Competitive Analysis: Checklist (HTML/JS) with expanded guidance on what to analyze. Goal: Inform/Organize. 6. Brainstorming (SCAMPER): Interactive tool (HTML/JS) with dynamic prompts and a user input area for practical application. Goal: Organize/Create. 7. Validate Your Idea: Process flow diagram (HTML/CSS) with clickable steps to reveal detailed explanations. Goal: Inform/Organize. 8. AI Advantage: Dynamic fact cards with icons (HTML/Tailwind) and expanded detail reveals. Goal: Inform. 9. Quizzes: Interactive multiple-choice quizzes (HTML/JS) for assessment. Goal: Assess/Practice. These choices turn the static report into an interactive, engaging, and comprehensive experience. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
